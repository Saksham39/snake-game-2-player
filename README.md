## How It Works
- **Two Snakes**: Two players control separate snakes on a 40x40 grid (800x800 canvas).
- **Controls**:
  - Player 1: Uses **WASD** keys (W: up, A: left, S: down, D: right).
  - Player 2: Uses **Arrow** keys (Up, Left, Down, Right).
- **Objective**: Collect randomly spawning fruits (🍎, 🍊, 🍇, 🍋, 🍉) to grow your snake and earn points.
- **Collisions**: The game ends if either snake hits the walls, itself, or the other snake.
- **Background**: A distracting animation with colorful, bouncing particles makes it harder to focus, increasing the challenge.
- **Scoring**: Scores and high scores are tracked and saved using `localStorage`.

## How to Play
1. Open the game in a web browser.
2. **Player 1**: Use **WASD** keys to move your green snake.
3. **Player 2**: Use **Arrow** keys to move your red snake.
4. Collect fruits to grow your snake and increase your score.
5. Avoid:
   - The canvas walls (40x40 grid boundaries).
   - Colliding with your own snake's body.
   - Colliding with the other player's snake.
6. Survive the distracting background animation to outlast your opponent.
7. When the game ends, an alert shows both players' scores, and the game resets.

## How Scores Are Calculated
- Each fruit collected adds **10 points** to the collecting player's score.
- **Player 1 Score**: Tracked separately for the green snake (WASD).
- **Player 2 Score**: Tracked separately for the red snake (Arrows).
- **High Score**: The highest score achieved by either player is saved in the browser's `localStorage` and persists across sessions.
- Displayed as: `Player 1: X | Player 2: Y | High Score: Z`.
